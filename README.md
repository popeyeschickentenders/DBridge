Imagine ssh for social media.

A quick and painless discord bot to run shell commands on a server via discord with togglable permissions - mostly for self hosted game servers for small communities.

## Note
- this is built with the intention of being ran on linux servers - This probably won't work windows (might work with macOS)
- when running on a linux server, create a new account (with `useradd -m`) for the bot or use an account that doesn't have any permissions as I wouldn't trust myself to write code thats 100% secure
- whitelisting commands is reccomended to be turned on unless you know what you're doing
